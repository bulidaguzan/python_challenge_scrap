# Scaling Product Data Collection System: Technical Proposal

## System Architecture Overview

### Data Collection Layer
- Implement a distributed scraping system using Apache Airflow for orchestration
- Deploy multiple worker nodes using containerized scraping services
- Utilize a queue system (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for task distribution
- Implement rate limiting and proxy rotation per domain
- Store scraping configurations (selectors, rules) in a version-controlled repository

### Data Processing & Storage
- Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL for scalability
- Implement a data lake architecture:
  - Raw data zone: Store original HTML/JSON responses
  - Processed zone: Normalized and enriched data
  - Serving zone: Optimized for downstream queries

### Taxonomy & Categorization
- Implement ML-based product categorization:
  - Train models on existing labeled data
  - Use NLP for product name/description analysis
  - Extract features from images for visual categorization
- Maintain a hierarchical category taxonomy in a graph database
- Implement fuzzy matching for brand/product normalization

### Image Processing Pipeline
- Implement async image processing using message queues
- Implement lazy generation of image sizes
- Use WebP format with JPEG fallback
- Store image metadata in dedicated service

### System Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of scraping workers
- Cache layer for frequently accessed data
- Implement auto-scaling based on queue size
- Load balancing for API endpoints

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring & Reliability
- Prometheus/Grafana for metrics
- Distributed tracing (Jaeger)
- Error tracking and alerting
- Automated recovery procedures
- Data quality monitoring


### Maintenance & Support
- CI/CD pipelines for deployment
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Documentation generation
- Monitoring dashboards
- Incident response procedures
